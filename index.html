                Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news.
                It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue.
                However, the term does not have a fixed definition, and has been applied more broadly to include any type of false information,
                including unintentional and unconscious mechanisms, and also by high-profile individuals to apply to any news unfavourable to their personal perspectives.
